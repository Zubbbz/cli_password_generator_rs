# Cli Password Generator

This is a learning exercise for me.

## Features:

- [x] Randomly generate a character from a charset
- [x] use arguments to specify:
  - [x] length
  - [ ] characters to include
    - [ ] Add a way to specify your own character set
    - [ ] Remove any duplicated characters
- [ ] add an argument to copy the result to clipboard
- [ ] find ways to make sure it is as random as possible (currently just using the rand library's default thread_rng )
